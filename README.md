# sql-assignments
As part of a Database Management Sytems course, I learned about relational databases and tables. I was also introduced to SQL in the class. I have uploaded some of the work I  did in the class. 

Assignment 4 shows a relational table setup I created for the course. It illustrates primary key attributes, and foreign key links. It also illustrates the types of connections tables have to one another (one-to-one, one-to-many, etc.)

Assignment 5 illustrates another database design and elaborates on how to achieve some tasks (for instance how to save processing time by avoiding the use of JOIN functions or removing subquery requirements) 

Assignment 3a is the actual SQL code I wrote to create a relational database regarding actresses and movies they have appeared in.
